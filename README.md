# COVID Community Risk Indicator

The COVID Community Risk Indicator is a map that shows hotspots around your current location, indicating that someone who has become ill has been there in the last 14 days. You can also search specific locations to see if they have been exposed.

If you fall ill, there is a button to report that you suspect you have contracted COVID-19, which will then ask you to anonymously submit your location logs for the last 14 days. The logs taken will be used to update the hotspots shown on the app.

The app's priority is data anonymity. Any location logs that are taken, if you are asked to share, will always be completely anonymous. Additionally, no neighborhoods will show hotspots as to retain the privacy of any infected users.

COVID Community Risk Indicator's location logging system and app template is from the open-source project, [Private Kit](https://github.com/tripleblindmarket/covid-safe-paths)
